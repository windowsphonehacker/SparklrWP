#Work in progress
This app isn't close to being feature complete. We are still far from a 1.0 release.

#Sparklr on Windows Phone 8.1
It is an upcoming client for the social network [Sparklr*](http://www.sparklr.me), which is currently in a closed beta phase. Although this app is created by a bunch of third-party-devs, we can say that we offer the first dedicated app for the growing social network.

##Features:
- [ ] chat
- [ ] posts, replies, images
- [ ] friends
- [ ] search
- [ ] live tile, toast and raw notifications
- [ ] users
- [ ] tags
- [ ] like/unlike
- [ ] repost

##How do I get it?
Currently we offer no downloads for the app...but If you do so wish you can always download the source code and compile yourself. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED! The app is HIGHLY unstable and may fail without notice...
As usual, we are not responsible for any lost data or damages to your device. Also, we can't be held liable if you're getting addicted to either the sparklr network or our app.

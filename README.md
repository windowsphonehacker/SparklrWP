#Sparklr on iOS, Android and WP [![Build Status](http://ci.dy.fi/buildStatus/icon?job=SparklrWP)](http://ci.dy.fi/job/SparklrWP/)
It is an upcoming client for the social network [Sparklr*](http://www.sparklr.me), which is currently in a closed beta phase. Although this app is created by a bunch of third-party-devs, we can say that we offer the first dedicated app for the growing social network.

##How do I get it?
The app is currently under heavy development, so it's not available in the marketplace right now. We do however have a build server that offers snapshots. If you have an unlocked device, head over to 
###http://ci.dy.fi/job/SparklrWP/
to download an highly unstable development build. As usual, we are not responsible for any lost data or damages to your device. Also, we can't be held liable if you're getting addicted to either the sparklr network or our app.
##How to open SparklrWP.sln?
You must install the WP7.8 SDK and use VS2012 (DON'T USE THE 2013 VERSION!!!)
##How to open the SparklriOSAndroid.sln?
You need a Mac with xcode, Android SDK and Xamarin Studio to compile these.
###The build server comes soon.
##How can I help you?
